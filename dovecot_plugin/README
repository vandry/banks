A fun (or not) Dovecot plugin that presents a Starling bank account
as an IMAP folder.

This configuration might work:

namespace {
  prefix = "prefix/"
  location = bank:~/some/directory
}

In /some/directory or any subdirectory thereof, create one symlink
and one file:

  ln -s /git/repo/directory/.git repo
  echo "category-id/account-id" >path
